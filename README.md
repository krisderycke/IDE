# IDE    
## Choosing one:
After looking into different IDE's, the IDE of my choice will be Visual Studio Code because on Google Trends it seems like the most popular and worldwide used program.  
This is particularly handy when you have issues and are looking for solutions.  
It also seems like a good program to use for front-end devs and has a built-in GIT control.  
Further more, i have no idea which one is better than the other.

## Pro's and Cons:  
#### Positives:  
* widely used, so alot of experienced users
* made for Windows, Mac and Linux
* it has useful hints and auto-completion  
### Negatives:  
* slow launch time, compared to some other IDE's  
* seems to be nothing more than an Atom clone (which might also be useful if you know Atom, IMO)
* uses alot of memory (allegedly)  
  
 ## Conclussion:
  I will use this IDE due to the fact that many developers also use this platform and seems to be very trendy compared to others.
