# IDE  
After looking into different IDE's, the IDE of my choice will be Visual Studio Code because on Google Trends it seems like the most popular and worldwide used program.  
This is particularly handy when you have issues and are looking for solutions.  
It also seems like a good program to use for front-end devs and has a built-in GIT control.  
Further more, i have no idea which one is better than the other.
