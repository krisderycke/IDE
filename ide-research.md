# IDE    ![ide](https://wakatime.com/static/img/editor-icons/vs-code-128.png)


## Choosing one:
     After looking into different IDE's, the IDE of my choice will be Visual Studio Code because on Google Trends it seems like the most popular and worldwide used program.
     
## What?
  Visual Studio Code can be used to write codes in different languages, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Ruby, etc. 
  Here is an example of a Ruby code:
     
 ```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

### Why?
>* This is particularly handy when you have issues and are looking for solutions.  
>* It also seems like a good program to use for front-end dev's.
>* Has a built-in GIT control.  
>    * Further more, i have no idea which one is better than the other.

## Pro's and Cons:  
|  Positives:|   Negatives:  |
|:----------------|------------------:|
|1. widely used, so alot of experienced users | * slow launch time, compared to some other IDE's|
|2. made for *Windows, Mac and Linux* |* seems to be nothing more than an Atom clone |
|3. it has useful hints and auto-completion | * uses alot of memory (allegedly :information_desk_person:) |  
 
  
 ## Conclussion:  
 - [x] [Download IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
 - [ ] watch GoT
 - [x] look for pro's and cons     
 - [ ] play ping-pong 
     
  
  I will use this IDE due to the fact that many developers also use this platform and seems to be `very trendy` compared to others.
